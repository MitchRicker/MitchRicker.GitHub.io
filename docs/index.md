# Experience

### MaineIT Enterprise Operations and Monitoring
---
#### Computer Operator (2018-2022)
I am very proud to have had the opportunity to serve our citizens while working with the State of Maine government on the EOM team. My primary duties here were to ensure that on-site backups were being run on schedule and that the many thousand disparate hosts on the network and in the datacenter were up and operational.

While monitoring the health and safety of the state network overnight I was also responsible for supporting the urgent support needs of our ~12,000 users, across multiple departments - each with their own unique set of applications and procedures.

Because of this rich diversity, I was able to delve deep into the state systems learning as much as I could and sharing that knowledge with the rest of the MaineIT using KCS methodologies combined with SEO.

#### Achievements:
* 100% Criminal Justice Information Services Level 4 Certification.
* Consistently over 85% positive customer service scores.
* Trained and onboarded 2 incredible team members.

### Zamanda Inc., A Carbonite Company
---
#### Support Engineer (2014-2018)
Working at Carbonite on the Zmanda team doing enterprise Linux backup was a remarkable experience. Here I was given the opportunity to explore many complex technologies at an in-depth level. Through their generous training programs I earned my Microsoft Technical Associate Server Administration certification.

The professional services tasks I engaged in with our enterprise clients exposed me to a wide range of host and network configurations at major companies and universities.

To make sure everything was as efficient as possible while dealing with high volumes of data, I wrote scripts in Bash, Python and Perl to automate various support tasks.

I became the Zmanda SME and was responsible for training and mentoring new team members. To make sure knowledge was as available as possible I maintained/audited the Zmanda knowledge base, administered a test/development VM lab offering GitLab, ADDS, Zmanda, Carbonite Server Backup and other services so team members could "play around" and developed the training materials to on-board new team members.

#### Achievements:
* My calls were played as examples of excellence to new-hires outside of the Zmanda team.
* Consistently over 85% positive customer service scores[^3].
* Trained and onboarded 8 amazing team members.

### Access World Wide
---
#### Support Representative (2011-2014)
As a managed service provider for AT&T, Access World Wide offered a fast-paced, exciting environment to develop my analytical thinking and customer service skills. In this position I was part technician, part accountant and part salesperson. I learned a lot about the AT&T system and products and was so glad to be able to share this knowledge with fellow team members.

After my first year, I was mentoring other agents as a "floor walker" in the call-center and providing content for the AT&T knowledge base. It was a pleasure to assist our customers in finding the best solution to their often complex and nuanced communications opportunities.

* Consistently over 85% positive customer service scores[^3].
* Mentored an exceptional team of 20.
